  abstract = {Abstract           The retrosplenial cortex is reciprocally connected with a majority of structures implicated in spatial cognition and damage to the region itself produces numerous spatial impairments. However, in many ways the retrosplenial cortex remains understudied. Here, we sought to characterize spatial correlates of neurons within the region during free exploration in two-dimensional environments. We report that a large percentage of retrosplenial cortex neurons have spatial receptive fields that are active when environmental boundaries are positioned at a specific orientation and distance relative to the animal itself. We demonstrate that this vector-based location signal is encoded in egocentric coordinates, localized to the dysgranular retrosplenial sub-region, independent of self-motion, and context invariant. Further, we identify a sub-population of neurons with this response property that are synchronized with the hippocampal theta oscillation. Accordingly, the current work identifies a robust egocentric spatial code in retrosplenial cortex that can facilitate spatial coordinate system transformations and support the anchoring, generation, and utilization of allocentric representations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Medial Entorhinal Cortex Layer-II stellate cells (mEC-LII-SCs) primarily interact via inhibitory interneurons. This suggests the presence of alternative mechanisms other than excitatory synaptic inputs for triggering action potentials (APs) in stellate cells during spatial navigation. Our intracellular recordings show that the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) allows Post- Inhibitory-Rebound-Spikes (PIRS) in mEC-LII-SCs. In-vivo, strong Inhibitory-Post-Synaptic- Potentials (IPSPs) immediately preceded most APs shortening their delay and enhancing excitability. In-vitro experiments showed that inhibition initiated spikes more effectively than excitation and that more dorsal mEC-LII-SCs produced faster and more synchronous spikes. In contrast, PIRS in Layer-II/III pyramidal cells (PCs) were harder to evoke, voltage-independent, and slower in dorsal mEC. In computational simulations, mEC-LII-SCs morphology and Ih homeostatically regulated the dorso-ventral (DV) differences in PIRS timing and most dendrites generated PIRS with a narrow range of stimulus amplitudes. These results suggest inhibitory inputs could mediate the emergence of grid cell firing in a neuronal network.},

  abstract = {Objective: A cognitive concern from the patient, informant, or clinician is required for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI); however, the cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates of complaint are poorly understood. We assessed how self-complaint relates to cognitive and neuroimaging measures in older adults with MCI. Method: MCI participants were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and dichotomized into two groups based on the presence of self-reported memory complaint (no complaint n=191, 77{$\pm$}7 years; complaint n=206, 73{$\pm$}8 years). Cognitive outcomes included episodic memory, executive functioning, information processing speed, and language. Imaging outcomes included regional lobar volumes (frontal, parietal, temporal, cingulate) and specific medial temporal lobe structures (hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex thickness, parahippocampal gyrus thickness). Results: Linear regressions, adjusting for age, sex, race, education, Mini-Mental State Examination, mood, and apolipoprotein E-4 status, found that cognitive complaint related to immediate ({$\beta$}=-1.07, p{$<$}0.001) and delayed episodic memory performances assessed on a serial list learning task ({$\beta$}=-1.06, p=0.001) but no other cognitive measures or neuroimaging markers. Conclusions: Self-reported memory concern was unrelated to structural neuroimaging markers of atrophy and measures of information processing speed, executive functioning, or language. In contrast, memory self-complaint related to objective verbal episodic learning performance. Future research is warranted to better understand the relation between cognitive complaint and surrogate markers of abnormal brain aging, including Alzheimer's disease, across the cognitive aging spectrum.},

The two classes of computational models often use either an oscillatory frequency or a firing rate that increases as a function of running speed. Yet it is currently not known whether these are two manifestations of the same speed signal or dissociable signals with potentially different anatomical substrates. We examined coding of running speed in MEC and identified these two speed signals to be independent of each other within individual neurons. The medial septum (MS) is strongly linked to locomotor behavior, and removal of MS input resulted in strengthening of the firing rate speed signal, while decreasing the strength of the oscillatory speed signal. Thus, two speed signals are present in MEC that are differentially affected by disrupted MS input.},

  abstract = {Neurons coding spatial location (grid cells) are found in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and demonstrate increasing size of firing fields and spacing between fields (grid scale) along the dorsoventral axis. This change in grid scale correlates with differences in theta frequency, a 6\textendash 10 Hz rhythm in the local field potential (LFP) and rhythmic firing of cells. A relationship between theta frequency and grid scale can be found when examining grid cells recorded in different locations along the dorsoventral axis of MEC. When describing the relationship between theta frequency and grid scale, it is important to account for the strong positive correlation between theta frequency and running speed. Plotting LFP theta frequency across running speeds dissociates two components of this relationship: slope and intercept of the linear fit. Change in theta frequency through a change in the slope component has been modeled and shown experimentally to affect grid scale, but the prediction that change in the intercept component would not affect grid scale has not been tested experimentally. This prediction about the relationship of intercept to grid scale is the primary hypothesis tested in the experiments presented here. All known anxiolytic drugs decrease hippocampal theta frequency despite their differing mechanisms of action. Specifically, anxiolytics decrease the intercept of the theta frequency-running speed relationship in the hippocampus. Here we demonstrate that anxiolytics decrease the intercept of the theta frequency-running speed relationship in the MEC, similar to hippocampus, and the decrease in frequency through this change in intercept does not affect grid scale.},

  abstract = {The spatial firing pattern of entorhinal grid cells may be important for navigation. Many different computational models of grid cell firing use path integration based on movement direction and the associated movement speed to drive grid cells. However, the response of neurons to movement direction has rarely been tested, in contrast to multiple studies showing responses of neurons to head direction. Here, we analyzed the difference between head direction and movement direction during rat movement and analyzed cells recorded from entorhinal cortex for their tuning to movement direction. During foraging behavior, movement direction differs significantly from head direction. The analysis of neuron responses shows that only 5 out of 758 medial entorhinal cells show significant coding for both movement direction and head direction when evaluating periods of rat behavior with speeds above 10 cm/s and 7301 angular difference between movement and head direction. None of the cells coded movement direction alone. In contrast, 21 cells in this population coded only head direction during behavioral epochs with these constraints, indicating much stronger coding of head direction in this population. This suggests that the movement direction signal required by most grid cell models may arise from other brain structures than the medial entorhinal cortex.},

  abstract = {Rebound spiking properties of medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) stellate cells induced by inhibition may underlie their functional properties in awake behaving rats, including the temporal phase separation of distinct grid cells and differences in grid cell firing properties. We investigated rebound spiking properties using whole cell patch recording in entorhinal slices, holding cells near spiking threshold and delivering sinusoidal inputs, superimposed with realistic inhibitory synaptic inputs to test the capacity of cells to selectively respond to specific phases of inhibitory input. Stellate cells showed a specific phase range of hyperpolarizing inputs that elicited spiking, but non-stellate cells did not show phase specificity. In both cell types, the phase range of spiking output occurred between the peak and subsequent descending zero crossing of the sinusoid. The phases of inhibitory inputs that induced spikes shifted earlier as the baseline sinusoid frequency increased, while spiking output shifted to later phases. Increases in magnitude of the inhibitory inputs shifted the spiking output to earlier phases. Pharmacological blockade of h-current abolished the phase selectivity of hyperpolarizing inputs eliciting spikes. A network computational model using cells possessing similar rebound properties as found in vitro produces spatially periodic firing properties resembling grid cell firing when a simulated animal moves along a linear track. These results suggest that the ability of mEC stellate cells to fire rebound spikes in response to a specific range of phases of inhibition could support complex attractor dynamics that provide completion and separation to maintain spiking activity of specific grid cell populations.},

  abstract = {Medial entorhinal cortex is the gateway between cortex and hippocampus, and plays a critical role for spatial coding as represented by grid cell activity. In the medial entorhinal cortex, inhibitory circuits are robust, and the presence of h-current leads to rebound potentials and rebound spiking in in vitro experiments. It has been hypothesized that these properties, combined with local field potential oscillations, may contribute to grid cell formation. To examine the properties of in vivo rebound spikes, we performed whole cell patch clamp recordings in medial entorhinal cortex neurons in anesthetized mice. We injected hyperpolarizing inputs representing inhibitory synaptic inputs with sinusoidal oscillations and found that hyperpolarizing inputs injected at specific phases of oscillation had higher probability of inducing subsequent spikes at the peak of the oscillation in some neurons. Also, this effect was prominent in the cells with large sag potential which is a marker of h-current. In addition, larger and longer hyperpolarizing current square pulse stimulation resulted in a larger probability of eliciting rebound spikes. We did not observe a relationship between amplitude or duration of hyperpolarizing current pulse stimulation and the delay of rebound spikes. These results suggest that rebound spikes are observed in vivo and may play a role in generating grid cell activity in medial entorhinal cortex neurons. This article is protected by copyright.
