  abstract = {Abstract           The retrosplenial cortex is reciprocally connected with a majority of structures implicated in spatial cognition and damage to the region itself produces numerous spatial impairments. However, in many ways the retrosplenial cortex remains understudied. Here, we sought to characterize spatial correlates of neurons within the region during free exploration in two-dimensional environments. We report that a large percentage of retrosplenial cortex neurons have spatial receptive fields that are active when environmental boundaries are positioned at a specific orientation and distance relative to the animal itself. We demonstrate that this vector-based location signal is encoded in egocentric coordinates, localized to the dysgranular retrosplenial sub-region, independent of self-motion, and context invariant. Further, we identify a sub-population of neurons with this response property that are synchronized with the hippocampal theta oscillation. Accordingly, the current work identifies a robust egocentric spatial code in retrosplenial cortex that can facilitate spatial coordinate system transformations and support the anchoring, generation, and utilization of allocentric representations.},

  abstract = {Neurophysiological recordings in behaving rodents demonstrate neuronal response properties that may code space and time for episodic memory and goal-directed behaviour. Here, we review recordings from hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex to address the problem of how neurons encode multiple overlapping spatiotemporal trajectories and disambiguate these for accurate memory-guided behaviour. The solution could involve neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus that show mixed selectivity, coding both time and location. Some grid cells and place cells that code space also respond selectively as time cells, allowing differentiation of time intervals when a rat runs in the same location during a delay period. Cells in these regions also develop new representations that differentially code the context of prior or future behaviour allowing disambiguation of overlapping trajectories. Spiking activity is also modulated by running speed and head direction, supporting the coding of episodic memory not as a series of snapshots but as a trajectory that can also be distinguished on the basis of speed and direction. Recent data also address the mechanisms by which sensory input could distinguish different spatial locations. Changes in firing rate reflect running speed on long but not short time intervals, and few cells code movement direction, arguing against path integration for coding location. Instead, new evidence for neural coding of environmental boundaries in egocentric coordinates fits with a modelling framework in which egocentric coding of barriers combined with head direction generates distinct allocentric coding of location. The egocentric input can be used both for coding the location of spatiotemporal trajectories and for retrieving specific viewpoints of the environment. Overall, these different patterns of neural activity can be used for encoding and disambiguation of prior episodic spatiotemporal trajectories or for planning of future goal-directed spatiotemporal trajectories.},

  abstract = {Rats readily switch between foraging and more complex navigational behaviors such as pursuit of other rats or prey. These tasks require vastly different tracking of multiple behaviorally significant variables including self-motion state. To explore whether navigational context modulates self-motion tracking, we examined self-motion tuning in posterior parietal cortex neurons during foraging versus visual target pursuit. Animals performing the pursuit task demonstrate predictive processing of target trajectories by anticipating and intercepting them. Relative to foraging, pursuit yields multiplicative gain modulation of self-motion tuning and enhances self-motion state decoding. Self-motion sensitivity in parietal cortex neurons is, on average, history dependent regardless of behavioral context, but the temporal window of self-motion integration extends during target pursuit. Finally, many self-motion-sensitive neurons conjunctively track the visual target position relative to the animal. Thus, posterior parietal cortex functions to integrate the location of navigationally relevant target stimuli into an ongoing representation of past, present, and future locomotor trajectories.},

Neurons in connected regions may encode an animal's position in the environment and location or proximity to objects or boundaries. RSC has also been shown to be important for spatial memory, such as tracking distance from and between landmarks, contextual information, and orientation within an environment. For these reasons, it is important to determine how neurons in RSC represent cues such as objects or boundaries and their relationship to the environment. In the current work, we performed electrophysiological recordings in RSC, whereas rats foraged in arenas that could contain an object or in which the environment was altered. We report RSC neurons display changes in mean firing rate responding to alterations of the environment. These alterations include the arena rotating, changing size or shape, or an object being introduced into the arena.},

  journal = {Neurobiology of Learning and Memory},
  abstract = {Humans and other animals are able to quickly generalize latent dynamics of spatiotemporal sequences, often from a minimal number of previous experiences.  Additionally, internal representations of external stimuli must remain stable, even in the presence of sensory noise, in order to be useful for informing behavior. In contrast, typical machine learning approaches require many thousands of samples, and generalize poorly to unexperienced examples, or fail completely to predict at long timescales.  Here, we propose a novel neural network module which incorporates hierarchy and recurrent feedback terms, constituting a simplified model of neocortical microcircuits.  This microcircuit predicts spatiotemporal trajectories at the input layer using a temporal error minimization algorithm.  We show that this module is able to predict with higher accuracy into the future compared to traditional models.  Investigating this model we find that successive predictive models learn representations which are increasingly removed from the raw sensory space, namely as successive temporal derivatives of the positional information.  Next, we introduce a spiking neural network model which implements the rate-model through the use of a recently proposed biological learning rule utilizing dual-compartment neurons.  We show that this network performs well on the same tasks as the mean-field models, by developing intrinsic dynamics that follow the dynamics of the external stimulus, while coordinating transmission of higher-order dynamics.  Taken as a whole, these findings suggest that hierarchical temporal abstraction of sequences, rather than feed-forward reconstruction, may be responsible for the ability of neural systems to quickly adapt to novel situations.},

This suggests the presence of alternative mechanisms other than excitatory synaptic inputs for triggering action potentials (APs) in stellate cells during spatial navigation. Our intracellular recordings show that the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) allows Post- Inhibitory-Rebound-Spikes (PIRS) in mEC-LII-SCs. In-vivo, strong Inhibitory-Post-Synaptic- Potentials (IPSPs) immediately preceded most APs shortening their delay and enhancing excitability. In-vitro experiments showed that inhibition initiated spikes more effectively than excitation and that more dorsal mEC-LII-SCs produced faster and more synchronous spikes. In contrast, PIRS in Layer-II/III pyramidal cells (PCs) were harder to evoke, voltage-independent, and slower in dorsal mEC. In computational simulations, mEC-LII-SCs morphology and Ih homeostatically regulated the dorso-ventral (DV) differences in PIRS timing and most dendrites generated PIRS with a narrow range of stimulus amplitudes. These results suggest inhibitory inputs could mediate the emergence of grid cell firing in a neuronal network.},

  abstract = {Objective: A cognitive concern from the patient, informant, or clinician is required for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI); however, the cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates of complaint are poorly understood. We assessed how self-complaint relates to cognitive and neuroimaging measures in older adults with MCI. Method: MCI participants were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and dichotomized into two groups based on the presence of self-reported memory complaint (no complaint n=191, 77{$\pm$}7 years; complaint n=206, 73{$\pm$}8 years). Cognitive outcomes included episodic memory, executive functioning, information processing speed, and language. Imaging outcomes included regional lobar volumes (frontal, parietal, temporal, cingulate) and specific medial temporal lobe structures (hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex thickness, parahippocampal gyrus thickness). Results: Linear regressions, adjusting for age, sex, race, education, Mini-Mental State Examination, mood, and apolipoprotein E-4 status, found that cognitive complaint related to immediate ({$\beta$}=-1.07, p{$<$}0.001) and delayed episodic memory performances assessed on a serial list learning task ({$\beta$}=-1.06, p=0.001) but no other cognitive measures or neuroimaging markers. Conclusions: Self-reported memory concern was unrelated to structural neuroimaging markers of atrophy and measures of information processing speed, executive functioning, or language. In contrast, memory self-complaint related to objective verbal episodic learning performance. Future research is warranted to better understand the relation between cognitive complaint and surrogate markers of abnormal brain aging, including Alzheimer's disease, across the cognitive aging spectrum.},

The two classes of computational models often use either an oscillatory frequency or a firing rate that increases as a function of running speed. Yet it is currently not known whether these are two manifestations of the same speed signal or dissociable signals with potentially different anatomical substrates. We examined coding of running speed in MEC and identified these two speed signals to be independent of each other within individual neurons. The medial septum (MS) is strongly linked to locomotor behavior, and removal of MS input resulted in strengthening of the firing rate speed signal, while decreasing the strength of the oscillatory speed signal. Thus, two speed signals are present in MEC that are differentially affected by disrupted MS input.},

  abstract = {Neurons coding spatial location (grid cells) are found in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and demonstrate increasing size of firing fields and spacing between fields (grid scale) along the dorsoventral axis. This change in grid scale correlates with differences in theta frequency, a 6\textendash 10 Hz rhythm in the local field potential (LFP) and rhythmic firing of cells. A relationship between theta frequency and grid scale can be found when examining grid cells recorded in different locations along the dorsoventral axis of MEC. When describing the relationship between theta frequency and grid scale, it is important to account for the strong positive correlation between theta frequency and running speed. Plotting LFP theta frequency across running speeds dissociates two components of this relationship: slope and intercept of the linear fit. Change in theta frequency through a change in the slope component has been modeled and shown experimentally to affect grid scale, but the prediction that change in the intercept component would not affect grid scale has not been tested experimentally. This prediction about the relationship of intercept to grid scale is the primary hypothesis tested in the experiments presented here. All known anxiolytic drugs decrease hippocampal theta frequency despite their differing mechanisms of action. Specifically, anxiolytics decrease the intercept of the theta frequency-running speed relationship in the hippocampus. Here we demonstrate that anxiolytics decrease the intercept of the theta frequency-running speed relationship in the MEC, similar to hippocampus, and the decrease in frequency through this change in intercept does not affect grid scale.},

Many different computational models of grid cell firing use path integration based on movement direction and the associated movement speed to drive grid cells. However, the response of neurons to movement direction has rarely been tested, in contrast to multiple studies showing responses of neurons to head direction. Here, we analyzed the difference between head direction and movement direction during rat movement and analyzed cells recorded from entorhinal cortex for their tuning to movement direction. During foraging behavior, movement direction differs significantly from head direction. The analysis of neuron responses shows that only 5 out of 758 medial entorhinal cells show significant coding for both movement direction and head direction when evaluating periods of rat behavior with speeds above 10 cm/s and 7301 angular difference between movement and head direction. None of the cells coded movement direction alone. In contrast, 21 cells in this population coded only head direction during behavioral epochs with these constraints, indicating much stronger coding of head direction in this population. This suggests that the movement direction signal required by most grid cell models may arise from other brain structures than the medial entorhinal cortex.},

We investigated rebound spiking properties using whole cell patch recording in entorhinal slices, holding cells near spiking threshold and delivering sinusoidal inputs, superimposed with realistic inhibitory synaptic inputs to test the capacity of cells to selectively respond to specific phases of inhibitory input. Stellate cells showed a specific phase range of hyperpolarizing inputs that elicited spiking, but non-stellate cells did not show phase specificity. In both cell types, the phase range of spiking output occurred between the peak and subsequent descending zero crossing of the sinusoid. The phases of inhibitory inputs that induced spikes shifted earlier as the baseline sinusoid frequency increased, while spiking output shifted to later phases. Increases in magnitude of the inhibitory inputs shifted the spiking output to earlier phases. Pharmacological blockade of h-current abolished the phase selectivity of hyperpolarizing inputs eliciting spikes. A network computational model using cells possessing similar rebound properties as found in vitro produces spatially periodic firing properties resembling grid cell firing when a simulated animal moves along a linear track. These results suggest that the ability of mEC stellate cells to fire rebound spikes in response to a specific range of phases of inhibition could support complex attractor dynamics that provide completion and separation to maintain spiking activity of specific grid cell populations.},

In the medial entorhinal cortex, inhibitory circuits are robust, and the presence of h-current leads to rebound potentials and rebound spiking in in vitro experiments. It has been hypothesized that these properties, combined with local field potential oscillations, may contribute to grid cell formation. To examine the properties of in vivo rebound spikes, we performed whole cell patch clamp recordings in medial entorhinal cortex neurons in anesthetized mice. We injected hyperpolarizing inputs representing inhibitory synaptic inputs with sinusoidal oscillations and found that hyperpolarizing inputs injected at specific phases of oscillation had higher probability of inducing subsequent spikes at the peak of the oscillation in some neurons. Also, this effect was prominent in the cells with large sag potential which is a marker of h-current. In addition, larger and longer hyperpolarizing current square pulse stimulation resulted in a larger probability of eliciting rebound spikes. We did not observe a relationship between amplitude or duration of hyperpolarizing current pulse stimulation and the delay of rebound spikes. These results suggest that rebound spikes are observed in vivo and may play a role in generating grid cell activity in medial entorhinal cortex neurons. This article is protected by copyright.
