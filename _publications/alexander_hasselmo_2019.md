title: 'Egocentric Boundary Vector Tuning Of The Retrosplenial Cortex'
collection: publications
Venue: NA 
abstract: 'Abstract The retrosplenial cortex is reciprocally connected with a majority of structures implicated in spatial cognition and damage to the region itself produces numerous spatial impairments However in many ways the retrosplenial cortex remains understudied Here we sought to characterize spatial correlates of neurons within the region during free exploration in twodimensional environments We report that a large percentage of retrosplenial cortex neurons have spatial receptive fields that are active when environmental boundaries are positioned at a specific orientation and distance relative to the animal itself We demonstrate that this vectorbased location signal is encoded in egocentric coordinates localized to the dysgranular retrosplenial subregion independent of selfmotion and context invariant Further we identify a subpopulation of neurons with this response property that are synchronized with the hippocampal theta oscillation Accordingly the current work identifies a robust egocentric spatial code in retrosplenial cortex that can facilitate spatial coordinate system transformations and support the anchoring generation and utilization of allocentric representations'
