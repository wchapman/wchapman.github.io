title: 'Neural Responses In Retrosplenial Cortex Associated With Environmental Alterations'
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
Venue: 'iScience'
abstract: 'The retrosplenial cortex RSC is an area interconnected with regions of the brain that display spatial correlates Neurons in connected regions may encode an animals position in the environment and location or proximity to objects or boundaries RSC has also been shown to be important for spatial memory such as tracking distance from and between landmarks contextual information and orientation within an environment For these reasons it is important to determine how neurons in RSC represent cues such as objects or boundaries and their relationship to the environment In the current work we performed electrophysiological recordings in RSC whereas rats foraged in arenas that could contain an object or in which the environment was altered We report RSC neurons display changes in mean firing rate responding to alterations of the environment These alterations include the arena rotating changing size or shape or an object being introduced into the arena'
