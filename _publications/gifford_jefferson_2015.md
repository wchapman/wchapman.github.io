abstract: 'Objective A cognitive concern from the patient informant or clinician is required for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment MCI however the cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates of complaint are poorly understood We assessed how selfcomplaint relates to cognitive and neuroimaging measures in older adults with MCI Method MCI participants were drawn from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and dichotomized into two groups based on the presence of selfreported memory complaint no complaint n191 77pm7 years complaint n206 73pm8 years Cognitive outcomes included episodic memory executive functioning information processing speed and language Imaging outcomes included regional lobar volumes frontal parietal temporal cingulate and specific medial temporal lobe structures hippocampal volume entorhinal cortex thickness parahippocampal gyrus thickness Results Linear regressions adjusting for age sex race education MiniMental State Examination mood and apolipoprotein E4 status found that cognitive complaint related to immediate beta107 p0001 and delayed episodic memory performances assessed on a serial list learning task beta106 p0001 but no other cognitive measures or neuroimaging markers Conclusions Selfreported memory concern was unrelated to structural neuroimaging markers of atrophy and measures of information processing speed executive functioning or language In contrast memory selfcomplaint related to objective verbal episodic learning performance Future research is warranted to better understand the relation between cognitive complaint and surrogate markers of abnormal brain aging including Alzheimers disease across the cognitive aging spectrum'
