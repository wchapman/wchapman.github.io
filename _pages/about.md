I am currently a researcher in Neuromorphic and Cognitive Computing at [Sandia National Labs](https://neuroscience.sandia.gov). My work here involves creating abstractions of architectures, dynamics, and learning rules from neuroscience findings. I then translate these abstractions into practical applications for next-generation machine intelligence, particularly on novel brain-inspired hardware.

I completed my PhD in Computational & Cognitive Neuroscience at Boston University, working with [Michael Hasselmo](http://bu.edu/hasselmo), where I investigated models of neocortical microcircuits that enabled self-supervised learning by predictive coding. 
Before starting my PhD I worked with [Randy O'Reilly](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/oreilly) during my master's program at University of Colorado Boulder, investigating neural mechanisms of attention. My undergraduate education was in biomedical engineering, where I developed microelectronics for lab-on-a-chip applications and created predictive models for [Alzheimer's Disease detection](https://www.vumc.org/vmac).
