abstract: 'The space of possible neural models is enormous and under-explored. Single cell computational
neuroscience models account for a range of dynamical properties of membrane potential, but typically do not
address network function. In contrast, most models focused on network function address the dimensions of
excitatory weight matrices and firing thresholds without addressing the complexities of metabotropic
receptor effects on intrinsic properties. There are many under-explored dimensions of neural parameter
space, and the field needs a framework for representing what has been explored and what has not. Possible
frameworks include maps of parameter spaces, or efforts to categorize the fundamental elements and
molecules of neural circuit function. Here we review dimensions that are under-explored in network models
that include the metabotropic modulation of synaptic plasticity and presynaptic inhibition, spike frequency
adaptation due to calcium-dependent potassium currents, and afterdepolarization due to calcium-sensitive
non-specific cation currents and hyperpolarization activated cation currents. Neuroscience research should
more effectively explore possible functional models incorporating under-explored dimensions of neural
function.'
