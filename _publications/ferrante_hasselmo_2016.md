abstract: 'Abstract Medial Entorhinal Cortex LayerII stellate cells mECLIISCs primarily interact via inhibitory interneurons This suggests the presence of alternative mechanisms other than excitatory synaptic inputs for triggering action potentials APs in stellate cells during spatial navigation Our intracellular recordings show that the hyperpolarizationactivated cation current Ih allows Post InhibitoryReboundSpikes PIRS in mECLIISCs Invivo strong InhibitoryPostSynaptic Potentials IPSPs immediately preceded most APs shortening their delay and enhancing excitability Invitro experiments showed that inhibition initiated spikes more effectively than excitation and that more dorsal mECLIISCs produced faster and more synchronous spikes In contrast PIRS in LayerII/III pyramidal cells PCs were harder to evoke voltageindependent and slower in dorsal mEC In computational simulations mECLIISCs morphology and Ih homeostatically regulated the dorsoventral DV differences in PIRS timing and most dendrites generated PIRS with a narrow range of stimulus amplitudes These results suggest inhibitory inputs could mediate the emergence of grid cell firing in a neuronal network'
