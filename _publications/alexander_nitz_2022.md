title: 'Adaptive Integration Of Selfmotion And Goals In Posterior Parietal Cortex'
collection: publications
Venue: NA 
abstract: 'Rats readily switch between foraging and more complex navigational behaviors such as pursuit of other rats or prey These tasks require vastly different tracking of multiple behaviorally signicant variables including selfmotion state To explore whether navigational context modulates selfmotion tracking we examined selfmotion tuning in posterior parietal cortex neurons during foraging versus visual target pursuit Animals performing the pursuit task demonstrate predictive processing of target trajectories by anticipating and intercepting them Relative to foraging pursuit yields multiplicative gain modulation of selfmotion tuning and enhances selfmotion state decoding Selfmotion sensitivity in parietal cortex neurons is on average history dependent regardless of behavioral context but the temporal window of selfmotion integration extends during target pursuit Finally many selfmotionsensitive neurons conjunctively track the visual target position relative to the animal Thus posterior parietal cortex functions to integrate the location of navigationally relevant target stimuli into an ongoing representation of past present and future locomotor trajectories'
