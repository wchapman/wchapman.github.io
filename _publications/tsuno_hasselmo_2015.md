abstract: 'Medial entorhinal cortex is the gateway between cortex and hippocampus and plays a critical role for spatial coding as represented by grid cell activity In the medial entorhinal cortex inhibitory circuits are robust and the presence of hcurrent leads to rebound potentials and rebound spiking in in vitro experiments It has been hypothesized that these properties combined with local field potential oscillations may contribute to grid cell formation To examine the properties of in vivo rebound spikes we performed whole cell patch clamp recordings in medial entorhinal cortex neurons in anesthetized mice We injected hyperpolarizing inputs representing inhibitory synaptic inputs with sinusoidal oscillations and found that hyperpolarizing inputs injected at specific phases of oscillation had higher probability of inducing subsequent spikes at the peak of the oscillation in some neurons Also this effect was prominent in the cells with large sag potential which is a marker of hcurrent In addition larger and longer hyperpolarizing current square pulse stimulation resulted in a larger probability of eliciting rebound spikes We did not observe a relationship between amplitude or duration of hyperpolarizing current pulse stimulation and the delay of rebound spikes These results suggest that rebound spikes are observed in vivo and may play a role in generating grid cell activity in medial entorhinal cortex neurons This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved'
