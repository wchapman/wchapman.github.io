  abstract = {The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) forms a unique monosynaptic processing loop with the extended hippocampal formation via the subiculum and entorhinal cortex. RSC may register current heading information and sensorimotor signals with hippocampal computations relating to spatial navigation in order to signal errors in position estimates based on sensory information and path integration. A primary mode by which RSC may provide feedback to the hippocampal formation for this hypothetical function is via excitatory projections from the region into deep layers of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), yet little has been examined with respect to coordination amongst these two regions. In the current work, we use both projection-specific in vivo calcium imaging and in vivo electrophysiological recordings to characterize co-activation dynamics in the RSC-MEC circuit at the single cell and population levels in freely moving rats performing spatial memory tasks.}
