I'm currently a PhD student in Computational & Cognitive Neuroscience at Boston University, working with [Michael Hasselmo](http://bu.edu/hasselmo). My research focuses on creating computational models of neocortex to investigate how cortical architecture can enable self-supervised learning by predictive coding.

Before starting my PhD I worked with [Randy O'Reilly](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/oreilly) during my master's program at University of Colorado Boulder. My undergraduate education was in biomedical engineering.
