  abstract = {Data from rodents shows neuronal activity that may code specific intervals of space and time, as revealed by recordings in structures implicated in episodic memory function. These data are relevant to modeling of episodic memories as spatiotemporal trajectories. The review will include data on neuronal actitivy that disambiguates overlapping spatiotemporal trajectories, as well as neurons that change firing rate and rhythmicity based on running speed and head direction. These data support the model of episodic memory as a trajectory that includes speed and direction, in contrast to Tulving's initial definition of episodic memory as a series of snapshots. Spatial behavior requires coding in multiple coordinate frames, and recent data supports the idea that space could involve neural coding of environmental boundaries in egocentric coordinates, as well as neural coding of transformations between egocentric input and memory that could be mediated by neurons coding allocentric location. These data will be discussed in the context of a more recent model of the transformation between coordinate systems. The egocentric input can be used both for coding the location along spatiotemporal trajectories and for retrieving specific viewpoints of the environment. The chapter will also include a brief discussion of the importance of mathematical models to move beyond verbal definitions.},
