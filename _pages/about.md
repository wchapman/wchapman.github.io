I research computation through dynamics to develop neurally inspired artificial intelligence (NeuroAI). By synthesizing computational neuroscience, dynamical systems, electrical engineering, and machine learning, I discover and implement mechanisms of coordinated computation across scales.

Currently, I am a researcher in Neuromorphic and Cognitive Computing at **[Sandia National Labs](https://neuroscience.sandia.gov)**. Here, I lead projects on physics-based computation in emerging hardware (physical neural networks), graph neural networks for scientific computing, and physics-informed neural networks.

My work is grounded in the study and functional abstraction of biological circuits. During my PhD in Computational Neuroscience at Boston University with **[Michael Hasselmo](http://bu.edu/hasselmo)**, I developed models of neocortical microcircuits to demonstrate self-supervised learning via predictive coding. Previously, I researched neural mechanisms of attention and hyperdimensional neurosymbolic computing with **[Randy O'Reilly](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/oreilly)** at the University of Colorado Boulder. My technical foundation is in biomedical and electrical engineering, ranging from microelectronics for lab-on-a-chip applications to predictive modeling for **[Alzheimer's Disease detection](https://www.vumc.org/vmac)**.
